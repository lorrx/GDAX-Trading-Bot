# GDAX Trading Bot

This program is an automated trading system that can autonomously trade the following currency pairs in the Coinbase Pro exchange. 
* LTC-BTC
* ETH-BTC
* ZRX-BTC
* EOS-BTC
* XLM-BTC

Keep in mind that trading is a risky activity that can involve a loss of money. You should only invest the amount you can afford to lose.

## Disclaimer
The current version of the GDAX Traiding bot was not fully tested yet. If there are any bugs, do not hesitate open a new issue ticket.

## Trading strategy

The trading strategy consists of issuing a large number of low value orders. The program continuously monitors the price of each coin and issues a market buy order when the price begins to rise above the weighted average of the previous prices. Once the buy order is filled, the program issues a limit sell order at a higher price.

### The seed

The seed is the amount of each coin that the program will trade continuously to earn bitcoins. The greater the seed, 
the greater the benefit. The seed values must be set in the program variables `SEED_LTC_AMOUNT`, `SEED_ETH_AMOUNT`, `SEED_ZRX_AMOUNT`, `SEED_EOS_AMOUNT` and `SEED_XLM_AMOUNT`.

You should be able to buy at least 10 seeds of each coin with your initial bitcoin balance. The more seeds you can buy, the easier it will be to recover from a losing streak.

Example:

- Your seeds are set as 1 ltc and 1 eth (default settings) 
- The price of litecoin is 0.01 btc and the price of ethereum is 0.02 btc
- You should be able to buy 10 seeds of each coin with your initial bitcoin balance
- Your minimum bitcoin balance should be: (0.01 + 0.02) * 10 = 0.3 btc
